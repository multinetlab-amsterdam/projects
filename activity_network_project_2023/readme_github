Folders containing dataframes for the analysis: 
 
- 20231901_df_main_analysis: contain the dataframes for the main analysis: df_peritumoral (only includes peritumoral data), df_peritumoral_all (only relevant for analysis relating peritumoral activity to relationships),
 			     df_homologue (only contains data on peritumoral homologue), df_non_tum (only contains data of rest of the brain). 
- 20231901_df_subtype_analysis: contains (the same as folder for main analysis) dataframes, but now for the different tumor subtypes 
- 20231901_df_standardized_beta_analysis: Contains standardized dataframes (on themselves) to obtain standardized coefficients in LMM analysis for effect size. 
- corrs_CC/EC_offset: contains dataframes with correlations between offset and network metrics for further analysis 
- df_within_subject_correlations: contains dataframes with Pearsons correlations between activity and network metrics for every subject 
- 20231901_df_raw_values: Dataframes containing the raw values of all metrics. Particularly used for the spin test analysis.

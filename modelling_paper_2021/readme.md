The scripts posted here were used in [papertitle]().

For privacy reasons, we cannot share the raw data alongisde with the scripts. Therefore, our aim here was to post a general version of the computations, allowing readers to understand how we computed the different parts of the analysis.

Step 1: Running the model
- run_model.m: /Please detail here this step/

Step 2: Correlations between simulations and empirical data
- corr_sim_mod.m: /Please detail here this step/

Step 3: Check the coupling value per subject  if the coupling value is the maximal value of the range this subject has to be ran again with the higher coupling range. Subsequently calculate whether the correlation between simulation and empirical data is higher compared to the coupling from the lower range.

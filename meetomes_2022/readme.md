**General overview:**
In this project, we recorded and transcribed research meetings from an interdisciplinary research team. 
To the transcripts, we applied conversation analysis to identify which actions team members took during the meeting (i.e. posing a question, delegating tasks, etc.). We merged these actions into coherent behavioral types; hub roles. Each hub role was hereby characterized by a specific set of actions. We aimed to analyze how the relative occurrence of hub actions impacted the connectome of the meeting (the meetome). Therefore, we calculated correlations and linear mixed models to determine the relationship between the relative occurrence of hub actions, network measures and meeting evaluations.
